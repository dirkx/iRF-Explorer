TODO:
    Check resizing updates
    There is a crash when you switch to a demo devicea s/when the pulldown menu updates
    Weird redraw issue in SpectrogramView (marked XX - caches under certain circumstances
    despite cahce off setting).
    Ugly _view hack in SomeTabView -- perhaps make full NSViewControllers or similar.
    Rewrite the NSViews/NSControls into more efficient NS(Action)Cells.
    We should set a timer parser send config - and if we do not get a config back in 0.5-1.5 seconds - ask for the config - as we are then possiby out of sync.
    Show min/max band setting in config panel about the board ??
    Hang on quickly toggling 2400 on/off - CFRunLoop & block on open interaction - but
    using non-blocked serial open clashes with entitlment rules and profiler.

PROTOCOL WISHES
-   When the device is not in mesure mode - but on some other menu flavour - it does not react to any # command. And once the user changes - does not give the #C's.
-   A way to have the PC change the active board (when there is an expansion one).
-   Send a command to the device to 'force' it into scan/measure more when it is in a config menu.
-   Learn min dBm step and freq. span's ranges on the wire rather than hardcode. Extra #C reply perhaps.
-   discover RBW from a C#
-   Special commend to set the device in remote measure mode during which the screen goes blank/unlit and/or keys get blocked.
-   A partially bogus #C (e.g. setting frequency to a silly value) does not yield a #C of what was actually taken/parsed. Better if the device rejected the whole string or always gave a #C reply so you know you're in sync.
-   Perhaps a master reset or other gauranteed to get device under control sequence.

Device/Hardware
- Finding out where below comes from (does the device quickly reset itself) ?

- Device can hang hard when dBm's are set -120 .. -110 or similar when 
  lines overshooting the scale. Powercylce will always reset it.

- Double check that top/bottom Amplitude are really display cut-offs - and that the 
  values you are getting are not getting scaled up between those bounds.
