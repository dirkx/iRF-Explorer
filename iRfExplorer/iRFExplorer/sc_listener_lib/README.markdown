SCListener 1.0.1-jkells.2
=========================

* This is a fork to add frequency detection. FFT is done using the kiss_fft library.

A simple class for listening to microphone levels and detecting frequency, suitable for the iPhone.

Usage
-----

    #import "SCListener.h" // Remember to link to AudioToolbox.framework.
    
    // Start listening.
    [[SCListener sharedListener] listen];
    
    // Retrieve the average power.
    [[SCListener sharedListener] averagePower];
    
    // Retrieve the peak power.
    [[SCListener sharedListener] peakPower];

    // Retrieve the dominant frequency
    [[SCListener sharedListener] frequency];

    // Hmm...we're using this guy a lot...
    SCListener *listener = [SCListener sharedListener];
    
    // We can temporarily stop returning levels
    [listener pause];
    [listener listen]; // Quick.
    
    // Or free up resources when we're not listening for awhile.
    [listener stop];
    [listener listen]; // Slower.
    
    // Advanced!:
    //
    // If you're using the average and the peak, fetch both at once.
    if (![listener isListening]) // If listener has paused or stopped...
      return;                    // ...bail.
    
    AudioQueueLevelMeterState *levels = [listener levels];
    Float32 peak = levels[0].mPeakPower;
    Float32 average = levels[0].mAveragePower;
